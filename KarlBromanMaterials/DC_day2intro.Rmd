## Spreadsheets

- make it a rectangle
- rows = observations, columns = variables
- one header row; avoid spaces
- one thing per cell
- fill in all cells
- consistent missing value codes
- care about dates (3 separate columns?)
- no calculations in raw data files
- save as CSV
- don't use font color or highlighting as data




## OpenRefine

- cleaning & exploration
- faceting / filtering
- splitting a column
- remove trailing/ending text
- cluster categories (to find typos)
- identify outliers
- all actions are reproducible



## SQL

```
    SELECT *
    FROM surveys
    WHERE species_id = 'DM' AND weight > 78
        (OR IN)
    ORDER BY
        (ASC DESC)
    GROUP BY
    COUNT(*), SUM(weight)
    JOIN ON
```


## Why databases?

- super-fast access to really large data sets

- careful curation of data that are complicated and/or constantly
  changing



##

<div class="centered" style="margin-top:250px; font-size:130%;">
File organization and naming <br/>
are powerful weapons against chaos.
</div>

<div style="margin-left:500px;">
&ndash; Jenny Bryan
</div>


## Organizing projects

- all files in common directory
- separate raw data from clean data
- separate code from data
- file names: meaningful, sortable, consistent
- dates like `2018-06-04`

## R

- full programming language
- focused on programming with data
- super for data analysis and visualization
- R Archive ("CRAN") has >10,000 add-on packages
- RStudio: "Integrated development environment" (IDE) for R


## dplyr


```
    select          SELECT *
    filter          WHERE
    mutate          weight/1000.0
    group_by        GROUP BY
    summarize       COUNT(*), AVG(weight)
    arrange         ORDER BY
```
