```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE,
                      warning=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=5.5)
```

This is an example to show how to write a R Markdown document.

First I'll load the packages and the data (from the web).

```{r load_data_and_libraries}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
surveys <- read.csv("https://kbroman.org/datacarp/portal_clean.csv")
```

The data has `r nrow(surveys)` rows and `r ncol(surveys)` columns.

Here's a scatterplot of hindfoot length vs weight:

```{r hfl_v_weight, fig.height=6}
ggplot(surveys, aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point()
```

Here are the first few lines of the data, for some selected columns:

```{r selected_data}
surveys %>% select(species_id, weight, hindfoot_length) %>% head()
```
